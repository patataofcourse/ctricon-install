## THIS IS STILL A WIP

A tool to install custom game icons into the Home Menu icon cache.
- Your custom icons will display in the Home Menu
- Potentially works with cartridges (?)
- No need to modify the ROM
- Incredibly easy to both set up and wipe

Limitations of this system:
- Anything other than the Home Menu will keep using the unmodified icon instead
- May be wiped after some time (needs testing)
